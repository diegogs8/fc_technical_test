description: One of our clients has decided to implement a system to visualize the performance of telecommunications vendors (such as Nokia, Ericsson, etc.) operating on their network.

What they need is a website that displays the **global ranking of all vendors** based on the **speed of their antennas** by technology, as well as a screen to display the ranking by type for each vendor.

They would also need an individual screen for each vendor showing their logo, name, date of foundation, and a list of their antennas, indicating the technology and speed.

Screen design will be assessed to ensure that it meets usability principles and that all views are interconnected.

To begin the project, they have provided us with all the information in a JSON file generated by their network monitoring system.

The test must be run using React and TypeScript, as they are part of Future Connections' current technology stack.** We leave it up to you to choose whether to use component libraries, styles, state management, utilities, or any other tools you deem appropriate.

sAs a requirement, the application must simulate a call to a backend that returns the JSON we have provided.** (*Development of a simple API in Python will be positively valued*)
